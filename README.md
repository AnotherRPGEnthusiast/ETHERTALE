# FUTURETALE
## "(a) crazy, fun au that's like a cross between Outertale, Deltarune and and a futuristic sci-fi adventure shounen series." -Amee, Author's Friend

# FUTURETALE

A coming of age CYOA AU with space travel, inventory management, sci-fi technology and choices that impact your playthrough as well as future playthroughs, just like the original UNDERTALE.
