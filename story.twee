/* <<checkboxPlus>> widget by HiEv
	This widget allows you to display a custom checkbox which sets a
	SugarCube variable, displays a (clickable) label, and satisfies
	accessibility guidelines for users with impairments (usable via the
	keyboard with TAB, SHIFT+TAB, and SPACE keys).  The	checkboxes are
	also larger, to make them easier to see and to click on for mobile
	devices.

	Usage: <<checkboxPlus "variableName" "text" ["className"]>>

	The value of the checkbox would then be tied to a variable, which
	is passed to the widget as a string.  All story variables passed to
	the widget will be set to either a Boolean true or false.  If the
	variable had a "truthy" value, then the checkbox will be checked.
	The	"className" is an optional parameter, which adds that CSS class
	to the text.

	Example: <<checkboxPlus "$EnabledOp" "Enable Option" "blueText">>

I have <<print $Frisk.inv.itemcounter>> item<<if $Frisk.inv.itemcounter gt 1 or $Frisk.inv.itemcounter eq 0>>s<<else>><</if>> on me.
I am wearing $Frisk.equipped.head on my head, $Frisk.equipped.torso on my body, and $Frisk.equipped.feet on my feet.
I am using $Frisk.weapon.has as a weapon.

:: Character Description [menuitem stoptime]

My name is Frisk. I'm an orphan, so I don't know my parents' last name. I used to live on the streets of Earth.
I'm likely high functioning autistic. I know a small amount of ASL (American Sign Language) from school before I graduated high school. I'm $Frisk.age and graduated from High School a year early.

<<link "Return." $return>><</link>>

It is giant... Much bigger than I imagined it to be before.

[[The Starship Bonetrousle.|Starship Bonetrousle]]  

:: Starship Bonetrousle

From the cover of the trees, I marvel at the huge ship. Word on the street is, the ship has a crew of only seven. How it can function on that tiny of a crew is beyond me. 
Crouching behind a bush, I wait stealthily until a stray box is left outside the humongous ship on it's lonesome, then I jump from behind the bush, arms pumping, $Frisk.equipped.feet slapping on the dirt and later the metal landing platform. Then I open the box up, and, jumping inside it, close it up again. Afterwards I quickly cover myself with a felt packing blanket, [[and wait.|Intro the ship]]

:: Intro the ship
<<addmins 4>>
I hear heavy footsteps, but somehow they seem more strong and confident than anything intimidating... "<span class="dtm-mono">A'right, one more box left!</span>" an ambiguously feminine voice rings out as the box I'm in lifts off the ground in one fluid motion. "<span class="dtm-mono">Huh, this box is heavy. Welp, in it goes!</span>" The <<hovertip "Monsters are a seperate race from humans, but lived and evolved on the same planet.">>monster<</hovertip>> starts moving with the box. I'm hesitating to breathe- I try to breathe as quietly as possible. <i><span class="dtm-mono">This has to work...</span></i> I think desperately. <i><span class="dtm-mono">I can't stay on this planet any longer. I need a new start!</span></i>

I can hear the footsteps turn hollow as they head onto the ship, then the cargo hold. Then there's a loud "thump!" as the crate hits the ground. She(?) doesn't know I'm in here, so she drops the crate- I have to fight to keep from grunting in pain, but thankfully I manage not to groan.

I hear her footsteps fading away, then a yell, "<span class="dtm-mono">Hey, Pap! Supplies are on! Let's hit the starstream!</span>"

I hear a loud, "<span class="papyrus">OKAY, UNDYNE!</span>" over the ship's speakers, the floor rumbling as the old rockets [[start up and stabilize.|Exit the crate]] 

:: Exit the crate

<span class="dtm-sans"><span class="glitch" data-text="Choose wisely.">Your first choice.</span></span>
<<addmins 6>>
After the footsteps die away through [[a pressurized door,|Starship hallway]] and later a second heavy rumbling signifies we've left the ground, I climb out of the crate. <<hovertip "The cargo hold. It's full of crates and other junk.">>The room I'm in<</hovertip>> is large, the size of a ballroom really, but only half of it is filled with stuff. Maybe <<hovertip "There might be something useful in here...">>[[exploring the cargo hold|Explore Cargo]]<</hovertip>> first before leaving might be a good idea? 

:: Explore Cargo
<<if $now.getHours gte 5 or $now.getHours lte 10 and visited() gt 1 and visited() lt 5>><span class="dtm-sans"><span class="glitch" data-text-"Try not to be a pig with the jerky, will you?">Try not to take too much jerky, will you?</span></span><<elseif $Frisk.inv.count("packet of beast jerky") gte 5>><span class="shadow"><span class="dtm-sans"><span class="glitch" data-text="You just couldn't resist. You piggy jerk.">You just had to do that, didn't you? Thanks for nothing!</span></span></span><</if>>

I look around, picking my way around and over crates. <<if visited() is 1>>I open one up, and find a crate of guns and a few very high-tech multi-function army knives. The guns are too big for me, but <span id="knife">I can <<link "take the knife.">><<set $Frisk.inv.equippable.concatUnique("high-tech army knife")>><<set $Frisk.inv.itemcounter ++>><<replace "#knife">>I've already taken a knife.

I've taken everything that was useful, sadly...<</if>>

:: Starship hallway

<<if previous("Explore Cargo") is true>>After exiting the cargo hold,<</if>> I enter a long, curved hallway. Should I go [[left|Engine room]] [[right|Starship hallway 2]] or [[try to find an air vent|Vent 1]] to hide in? 

<<timed 20s>><<goto "Footsteps">><</timed>>

:: Vent 1
I<<if previous("Footsteps") is true>> scrambled <<elseif previous("Starship hallway") is true>> climbed <</if>>into the vent. <<if previous("Starship hallway") is true and visited() is 1>> It's too dark to see past the first few feet, so I probably wouldn't be able to use these vents to transport myself, but they are good for hiding in. I <<link "exit the vent.">><<return>><</link>><<elseif previous("Footsteps") is true>>I quiet my breathing as the footsteps pass, trying not to shuffle uncomfortably in the tiny vent. Once the danger passes, I <<link "exit the vent.">><<return>><</link>> <</if>>


:: Footsteps

There are footsteps coming down the hallway! [[I should probably hide|Vent 1]]!

<<timed 5s>> I should hurry! The footsteps are getting closer!<</timed>>
